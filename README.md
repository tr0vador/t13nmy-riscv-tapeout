"""# t13nmy-riscv-tapeout

This repository documents my journey in the **RISC-V Tapeout project**.  
It contains the work I do as part of learning, experimenting, and implementing various steps of the RISC-V SoC design and tapeout process.

## Contents
- Source files and code related to the project  
- Documentation of tasks and learnings  
- Screenshots and results of experiments  

## Goal
To gain hands-on experience with the **RISC-V ecosystem**, digital design tools, and the full tapeout flow.
